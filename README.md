# 🐱 smol oneko

Want to add oneko.js to your site but 6 KB is just too much? Now it's 1.8 KB!

The default image is `oneko.gif` in the same directory as the script. This can be changed by adding `data-cat="yourimage.gif"` to your `<script>` tag.

# 📖 Lexicon

The variable names in the script have been truncated (and, as a side effect, obfuscated) to reduce file size. If you would like to tweak the script to your liking, see the [LEXICON.md](https://github.com/ovnanova/smoloneko/blob/main/LEXICON.md) guide.

## 🏆 Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request if you see any fixes or further optimizations to be made. If you want to add functionality, I would suggest starting your own fork.
